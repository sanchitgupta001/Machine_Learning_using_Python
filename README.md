# Machine_Learning_using_Python
This repository contains implementations on some of the machine learning algorithms.

Clone this repository using : 
git clone https://github.com/sanchitgupta001/Machine_Learning_using_Python

cd Machine_Learning_using_Python

Install all the required libraries using : 
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt (for Python3)

For the ones who are working on Windows, I would recommend using Anaconda software compatible with Python3.
No need to install all requirements in Anaconda. Only install Quandl by executing following command on command prompt:
conda install quandl

That's It.....
Any errors or suggestions are always welcomed.....

Hope you like it ! .........  :)
